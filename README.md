# inhibitory_neural_network_NYUSH
Jiatong's work on project 'How inhibitory circuits govern multiband neural oscillations' during his stay in NYUSH 2024 summer.

[Code]
multi_band: Each code profile has description at the beginning of the code.

[Bare Data]
V1_structure: an xlsx file of how number of neurons and proportions in every layer were calculated, from Allen Institute
Num_TC_synapses: an xlsx file of how we determined the number of synapses each LGN cells makes on a V1 neuron in different layers, from Allen Institute
Connection_probabilities: Interactive PowerPoint with all connection probabilities (at 75 micrometers). You can click on every number to see the references used and assumptions (if any), from Allen Institute
Connection_strengths: Interactive PowerPoint with all connection strengths (unitary PSP in mV). You can click on every number to see the references used and assumptions (if any), from Allen Institute
Projection_probability_Jiatong: it contains data and formulas about how Jiatong determine the average number of neurons that are projecting to one specific neuron.
